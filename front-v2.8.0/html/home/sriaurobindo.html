                                    being released from Alipur Jail, was on 30th May’1909 at Uttarpada, West Bengal. In
                                    this speech, he shared his spiritual experiences during his stay in the jail. He
                                    gave a message on the true spirit of nationalism and also explained clearly what a
                                    true Hindu religion or ‘Sanatan Dharm’ is all about? He emphasized on why todays’
                                    world needs it more than ever. The speech reflects a remarkable turning point in

                                                    was he that you came in hundreds to welcome. Now he is far away,
                                                    separated from us by thousands of miles. Other people, whom I was
                                                    accustomed to working beside me, are absent today. The storm that
                                                    swept over the country has scattered them far and wide. This time it
                                                    is I, who spent one year in seclusion, and now that I have come out,
                                                    I find that everything has changed. One, who always sat by my side
                                                    and was associated in my work, is a prisoner in Burma; another is in
                                                    the north rotting in detention. I looked around when I came out, I
                                                    looked around for those, whom I was accustomed to look for counsel
                                                    and inspiration. I did not find them.

                                                    country was alive with the cry of ‘Vande Mataram’, alive with the
                                                    hope of formation of a nation. This was the hope of millions of men
                                                    who had risen out of a pathetic state. When I came out of jail I
                                                    listened for that cry, but there was instead a silence. A hush had
                                                    fallen over the country and men seemed bewildered; for instead of
                                                    God’s bright heaven full of vision of the future that had been
                                                    before us, there seemed to be overhead, a leaden sky from which
                                                    human thunders and lightnings rained. No man seemed to know which
                                                    way to move, and from all sides came the question, “What shall we do
                                                    next? What is there that we can do?” I too did not know which way to
                                                    move, I too did not know what next to be done. But one thing I knew,
                                                    that as it was the Almighty Power of God which had raised that cry,
                                                    that hope, so it was the same Power which had sent down that
                                                    silence.

                                                    with a message, and it was an inspired message. I remember the
                                                    speech he made here. It was a speech not so much political as
                                                    religious in its bearing and intention. He spoke of his realization
                                                    in jail, of God within us all, of the Lord within the nation, and in
                                                    his subsequent speeches also he spoke of a greater than ordinary
                                                    force in the movement and a greater than ordinary purpose before it.

                                                    is you, people of Uttarpara, who are the first to welcome me, not at
                                                    a political meeting but at a meeting of a society for the protection
                                                    of our religion. That message which Bipin Chandra Pal received in
                                                    Buxar jail; God gave to me in Alipore. That knowledge, He gave me
                                                    day after day during my twelve months of imprisonment and it is that
                                                    which He has commanded me to speak to you now that I have come out.

                                                    had no wish to speak. The thing I had in my mind, He has thrown them
                                                    away and what I speak is under an inspiration and compulsion.

                                                    month in a solitary cell apart from men. There I waited day and
                                                    night for the voice of God within me, to know what He had to say to
                                                    me, to learn what I had to do. In this seclusion the earliest
                                                    realization, the first lesson came to me. I remembered then that a

                                                    the ‘sadhana’ of the Gita. I wanted to understand not only
                                                    intellectually but also by realization what Sri Krishna demanded of
                                                    Arjuna and what he demands of those who aspire to do His work- to be
                                                    free from hatred and desires, to work for Him without expecting the
                                                    fruit, to renounce self-will and become a passive and faithful
                                                    instrument in His hands, to have an equal heart for high and low,
                                                    friend and opponent, success and failure, yet not to do His work
                                                    negligently. I realized what the Hindu religion meant. We speak
                                                    often of the Hindu religion, of the ‘Sanatan Dharma’, but few of us
                                                    really know what that religion is. Other religions are predominantly
                                                    religions of faith and fasting, but the ‘Sanatan Dharma’ is life
                                                    itself; it is a thing that is not so much to be believed as lived.

                                                    in the morning and in the evening.” So, it was arranged, and it was
                                                    while I was walking that His strength again entered into me. I
                                                    looked at the jail that secluded me from men and it was no longer by

                                                    surrounded me. I walked under the branches of the tree in front of
                                                    my cell but it was not the tree, I knew it was Vasudeva, it was Sri
                                                    Krishna whom I saw standing there and holding over me his shade.

                                                    He spoke to me and said, “Behold the people among whom I have sent
                                                    you to do a little of my work. This is the nature of the nation I am

                                                    brought before the Magistrate I was followed by the same insight. He
                                                    said to me, “when you were cast into jail, did not your heart fail
                                                    and did you not cry out to me, where is Thy protection? Look now at
                                                    the Magistrate, look at the Prosecuting Counsel.” I looked and it
                                                    was not the Magistrate whom I saw, it was Vasudeva, it was Narayana
                                                    who was sitting there on the bench. I looked at the Prosecuting
                                                    Counsel and it was not the counsel for the prosecution that I saw;
                                                    it was Sri Krishna who sat there, it was my Lover and Friend who sat
                                                    there and smiled. “Do you fear now?” He said, “I am in all men and I
                                                    rule over all of their actions and words.

                                                    It is not for you. It was not for the trial that I brought you here
                                                    but for something else. The case itself is only a means for my work
                                                    and nothing more.” Afterwards when the trial opened in the Sessions
                                                    Court, I began to write instructions for my Counsel as to what was
                                                    false in the evidence against me and on what points the witnesses
                                                    might be cross-examined. Then something happened which I had not
                                                    expected. The arrangements which had been made for my defense were
                                                    suddenly changed and another Counsel stood there to defend me. He
                                                    came unexpectedly-a friend of mine, but I did not know he was
                                                    coming.

                                                    and mighty nation that is arising at my command. They are greater
                                                    than yourself. What have you to fear? If you stood aside or slept,
                                                    the work would still be done. If you were cast aside tomorrow, here
                                                    are the young men who will take up your work and do it more
                                                    effectively than you have ever done. You have only got some strength
                                                    from me to speak a word to this nation which will help to raise it.”
                                                    This was the second thing that He told me.

                                                    one that is different or contrary. It is the ‘Shakti’ that has gone
                                                    forth and entered into the people. Since long ago I have been
                                                    preparing this uprising and now the time has come and it is I who
                                                    will lead it to its fulfillment.”

                                                    is the Hindu religion? What is this religion which we call
                                                    ‘Sanatan’, eternal? It is the Hindu religion only because the Hindu
                                                    nation has kept it, because in this Peninsula it grew up in the

                                                    bounded part of the world. That which we call the Hindu religion is
                                                    really the eternal religion, it is a universal religion because it
                                                    embraces all other religion. If a religion is not universal, it
                                                    cannot be eternal. A narrow religion, a sectarian religion, a
                                                    conservative religion can live only for a limited time and a limited
                                                    purpose. This is the only religion that can triumph over materialism
                                                    by including and anticipating the discoveries of science and the
                                                    speculations of philosophy. It is the only religion which impresses
                                                    on mankind the closeness of God to us and by which man can approach
                                                    God. It is the only religion which insists every moment upon the
                                                    fact, which all religions also acknowledge that He is in all men and
                                                    all things and that in Him we move and have our being. It is the
                                                    only religion which enables us not only to understand and believe
                                                    this truth but to realize it with every part of our being. It is the
                                                    only religion which shows the world that the world is ‘the Leela’ of
                                                    Vasudeva. It is the only religion which shows us how we can best
                                                    play our part in that Leela, its subtlest laws and its noblest
                                                    rules. It is the only religion which does not separate life in any
                                                    smallest detail from religion, which knows what immortality is and
                                                    has completely removed from us the reality of death.

                                                    us is nationalism. This Hindu nation was born with the ‘Sanatan
