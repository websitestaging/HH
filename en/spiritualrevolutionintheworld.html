                                        and synthesize thoughts. Because of man’s power of intelligent reasoning,
                                        scientists have put him at the zenith of the evolutionary spiral.

                                        evolutionary glory. A closer look at this phenomenon tells us that the growth of
                                        human mind has so far been limited to exploiting the potential of matter. This
                                        is reflected in the spectacular growth of physical science that has put man in
                                        space and begun unlocking the mysteries of human body through research in areas
                                        such as genome mapping, cellular biology and stem cells.</p>

                                        has not gone beyond the realm of psycho-physical research. In fact, research
                                        into deeper aspects of human mind always invariably ends with scientists probing
                                        the brain. This is because modern science cannot believe or perceive that human
                                        body and mind could be linked to another state of consciousness that exists
                                        beyond the limits of our physical world. The result is that the potential
                                        possibilities of spirit, vis-à-vis matter, have been left to the interpreters of
                                        religion and spirituality. This has caused a neat division between scientists
                                        and religious leaders, making them look at each with a degree of suspicion and
                                        even hostility.

                                        deeply impacted by it. The progress in science and technology has therefore led
                                        to greater physical comforts but not to peace of mind. If anything, material
                                        progress stemming from new scientific discoveries has only led to competition,
                                        conflict, discord and internecine struggle in human society.

                                        masters and seers, had accurately diagnosed the current crisis in human society
                                        as the result of the imbalance in man’s treatment of matter and spirit. He
                                        argued that mankind would not be at peace with itself unless it achieved a
                                        correct balance in exploring the potential of spirit and matter and linking them
                                        together. Man, he said, is not at the pinnacle of life’s evolutionary cycle on
                                        earth. Man is only a ‘transitional being’. He is yet to evolve further in the
                                        realm of spirit. It is only when man evolves higher into the remaining stages of
                                        consciousness that he will have reached the zenith of life’s evolution on our
                                        planet.

                                        Pranamaya Kosha (air-apparent sheath), Manomaya Kosha (mind-stuff-apparent

                                        only if the cosmic consciousness (described as Krishna’s supramental force)
                                        descended on earth. On November 24, 1926, the Mother announced to a small group
                                        of Sri Aurobindo’s disciples that Krishna’s supramental force had descended on

                                        who was thus chosen for the manifestation of the Krishna consciousness in the
                                        physical world, would himself undergo the last three stages of ‘Anand’, ‘Chit’
                                        and ‘Sat’. The chosen one’s mission would be to bring about the kind of
                                        spiritual evolution that he has undergone himself among others. Sri Aurobindo
                                        and the Mother were also convinced that if one man on earth underwent complete
                                        spiritual revolution, it was practically possible for millions of others to
                                        experience this divine transformation if they followed the same path as the
                                        Chosen One.

                                        conscious of his real mission on earth. This happened in 1969 when Guru Siyag
                                        achieved the Gayatri Siddhi in the wee hours of a winter morning in a Rajasthan
                                        town. In the town of Pondichery in southern India, Mother, who was always
                                        connected with cosmic consciousness, instantly received the vibrations of this
                                        momentous happening. She simply said her own mission was complete, as Krishna’s
                                        supramental force had become active that day. Given below is an excerpt from
                                        Mother’s writings of the vision she saw:

                                        supramental forces into the “body” everywhere at the same time, as though the
                                        whole body “bathed” in the forces that entered everywhere at the same time with
                                        a slight friction, the head down to the neck was the last receptive region."

                                        consciousness descended into the earth’s atmosphere and “settled” there. It was
                                        a most marvelous descent, full of light, force, power, joy and peace and

                                    <p class="text-dark">In speaking of this episode, Guru Siyag says that he was able
                                        to experience the final three Kosha of Ananda, Chitta and Sat. He also says that
                                        from that day onwards he experienced a
                                        transformation in his very being. In subsequent communications with his Guru
                                        Gangainathji from the plane of the spirit, Guru Siyag was told that it was his
                                        mission to bring about a spiritual revolution by becoming the medium for the
                                        Divine Transformation of all mankind. West is the leader of the world’s material
                                        progress. So Guru Siyag is keen to take GSSY to the West to begin a spiritual
                                        movement based on cosmic consciousness. He believes that only such a movement
                                        will eventually bring about a union of East’s spiritualism and West’s
                                        materialism to usher in a true spiritual revolution in mankind.
