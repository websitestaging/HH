                                    later left politics to pursue his spiritual sadhana. Sri Aurobindo founded an ashram

                                                    1872. At a young age, he was sent to England to be educated at St
                                                    Paul’s. Sri Aurobindo was an excellent student and won a scholarship
                                                    to read classics at King’s College Cambridge. It was at university
                                                    that the young Aurobindo became increasingly interested in the
                                                    fledgling Indian independence movement. Given a chance to enter the
                                                    civil service, Aurobindo deliberately failed as he didn’t want to
                                                    work for the British Empire.

                                                    he took up a position as a teacher. It was also on returning to
                                                    India that Aurobindo recounts his first most significant spiritual
                                                    experience. He relates on how returning to Indian soil he was
                                                    inundated with a profound peace. This experience came unsought but
                                                    at the same time, he continued to become more deeply connected with
                                                    the Indian independence movement. Aurobindo was one of the first
                                                    Indian leaders to openly call for complete Indian independence; at
                                                    the time, the Indian Congress wanted only a partial independence. In
                                                    1908 Aurobindo was implicated in the Alipore bomb plot in which two
                                                    people died. As a consequence, Aurobindo was jailed whilst awaiting
                                                    trial.

                                                    life-changing spiritual experience. He began to meditate very deeply
                                                    and inwardly received spiritual instruction from Swami Vivekananda
                                                    and Sri Krishna. From the depths of the British prison, Aurobindo
                                                    saw that Brahmin or God pervaded the entire world. There was nothing
                                                    that was separated from the existence of God. Even in the worst
                                                    criminal, Aurobindo saw at heart – God or Vasudev.

                                                    to practise meditation and spiritual disciplines. In Pondicherry, he
                                                    also began to attract a small group of spiritual seekers who wished
                                                    to follow Sri Aurobindo as a Guru.

                                                    name of Mirra Richards (b. Alfassa) came to visit Pondicherry. Sri
                                                    Aurobindo saw in her a kindred spirit. Later he would say himself
                                                    and the Mother (Mirra Richards) were one soul in two bodies. After
                                                    the Mother settled in the ashram in 1920, the organisation of the
                                                    Ashram was left in her hands whilst Sri Aurobindo increasingly
                                                    retreated to give him more time for meditation and writing.

                                                <p class="text-dark"></p> Sri Aurobindo was a prolific writer writing
                                                some of
                                                the most detailed and comprehensive discourses on spiritual
                                                evolution. Sri Aurobindo said that his inspiration to write came
                                                from his inner pilot, from a higher source. Sri Aurobindo wrote
                                                extensively, in particular, he spent many hours patiently replying
                                                to the questions and problems of his disciples. Even on the smallest
                                                detail, Sri Aurobindo would reply with great care, attention and
                                                often good humour. It is interesting to note that Sri Aurobindo
                                                often refused to write for prestigious newspapers and journals, he
                                                frequently turned down requests to return to leadership of the
                                                Indian independence movement. Sri Aurobindo was also a Seer Poet of
                                                the highest order. His epic Savitri is a testimony to his own
                                                spiritual sadhana. For over 20 years he continually refined and
                                                amended this mantric poetic output. It became one of the most
                                                powerful testimonies of his spiritual consciousness.

                                                    swept over the country has scattered them far and wide. This

                                                    is I, who spent one year in seclusion, and now that I have
                                                    come out,
                                                    I find that everything has changed. One, who always sat by
                                                    my side
                                                    and was associated in my work, is a prisoner in Burma;
                                                    another is in
                                                    the north rotting in detention. I looked around when I came
                                                    out, I
                                                    looked around for those, whom I was accustomed to look for
                                                    counsel
                                                    and inspiration. I did not find them.

                                                    whole
                                                    country was alive with the cry of ‘Vande Mataram’, alive
                                                    with the
                                                    hope of formation of a nation. This was the hope of millions
                                                    of men
                                                    who had risen out of a pathetic state. When I came out of
                                                    jail I
                                                    listened for that cry, but there was instead a silence. A
                                                    hush had
                                                    fallen over the country and men seemed bewildered; for
                                                    instead of
                                                    God’s bright heaven full of vision of the future that had
                                                    been
                                                    before us, there seemed to be overhead, a leaden sky from
                                                    which
                                                    human thunders and lightnings rained. No man seemed to know
                                                    which
                                                    way to move, and from all sides came the question, “What
                                                    shall we do
                                                    next? What is there that we can do?” I too did not know
                                                    which way to
                                                    move, I too did not know what next to be done. But one thing
                                                    I knew,
                                                    that as it was the Almighty Power of God which had raised
                                                    that cry,
                                                    that hope, so it was the same Power which had sent down that
                                                    silence.

                                                    meant only for a year of seclusion and training. How could

                                                    hold me in jail longer than was necessary for God’s purpose?

                                                    given me a message to speak and a work to do, and until that

                                                    was told, I knew that no human power could hush me, until

                                                    that instrument might be or however small. Now that I have

                                                    had no wish to speak. The thing I had in my mind, He has

                                                    My work
                                                    was very dear to me and in my heart, I was proud of it and
                                                    thought
                                                    that unless I was there, it would suffer or even fail and

                                                    Therefore, I could not leave it. It seemed to me that He
                                                    spoke to me
                                                    again and said, “The bonds you did not have the strength to
                                                    break, I
                                                    have broken for you, because it is not my will nor was it
                                                    ever my
                                                    intention that it should continue. I have another thing for
                                                    you to
                                                    do and it is for that, I have brought you here, to teach you
                                                    what
                                                    you could not learn for yourself and to train you for my
                                                    work.” Then
                                                    He placed the Gita in my hands.

                                                    few of us
                                                    really know what that religion is. Other religions are
                                                    predominantly
                                                    religions of faith and fasting, but the ‘Sanatan Dharma’ is
                                                    life
                                                    itself; it is a thing that is not so much to be believed as

                                                    me-He made me realize the core truth of the Hindu religion.
                                                    He
                                                    turned the hearts of my jailors towards me and they spoke to

                                                    Englishman in charge of the jail, “He is suffering in his

                                                    in the morning and in the evening.” So, it was arranged, and
                                                    it was
                                                    while I was walking that His strength again entered into me.
                                                    I
                                                    looked at the jail that secluded me from men and it was no

                                                    its high walls that I was imprisoned; no, it was Vasudeva
                                                    who
                                                    surrounded me. I walked under the branches of the tree in
                                                    front of
                                                    my cell but it was not the tree, I knew it was Vasudeva, it
                                                    was Sri
                                                    Krishna whom I saw standing there and holding over me his

                                                    who sat
                                                    there and smiled. “Do you fear now?” He said, “I am in all
                                                    men and I
                                                    rule over all of their actions and words.

                                                    Court, I began to write instructions for my Counsel as to

                                                    false in the evidence against me and on what points the
                                                    witnesses
                                                    might be cross-examined. Then something happened which I had

                                                    expected. The arrangements which had been made for my

                                                    suddenly changed and another Counsel stood there to defend
                                                    me. He
                                                    came unexpectedly-a friend of mine, but I did not know he

                                                <p class="text-dark">Then I found myself among these young men
                                                    and in
                                                    many of them I discovered a mighty courage, a power of
                                                    self-effacement in comparison to which I was simply nothing.
                                                    Among
                                                    them, there were one or two, who were not only like me in
                                                    strength
                                                    and character, as there were many like that, but were also
                                                    far
                                                    superior in the promise of that intellectual ability on
                                                    which I
                                                    prided myself. He said to me, “This is the young generation,
                                                    the new
                                                    and mighty nation that is arising at my command. They are
                                                    greater
                                                    than yourself. What have you to fear? If you stood aside or
                                                    slept,
                                                    the work would still be done. If you were cast aside
                                                    tomorrow, here
                                                    are the young men who will take up your work and do it more
                                                    effectively than you have ever done. You have only got some
                                                    strength
                                                    from me to speak a word to this nation which will help to
                                                    raise it.”
                                                    This was the second thing that He told me.

                                                    God at all. I did not feel His presence. Yet something drew
                                                    me to
                                                    the truth of the Vedas, the truth of the Gita, the truth of
                                                    the
                                                    Hindu religion. I felt there must be a mighty truth
                                                    somewhere in
                                                    this Yoga, a mighty truth in this religion based on the
                                                    Vedanta.

                                                    have satisfied you. When you go forth, speak to your nation
                                                    always

                                                    for the world and not for themselves that they rise. I am

                                                    them freedom to serve the world.

                                                    single country. It does not belong particularly and forever
                                                    to a
                                                    bounded part of the world. That which we call the Hindu
                                                    religion is
                                                    really the eternal religion, it is a universal religion
                                                    because it
                                                    embraces all other religion. If a religion is not universal,
                                                    it
                                                    cannot be eternal. A narrow religion, a sectarian religion,
                                                    a
                                                    conservative religion can live only for a limited time and a
                                                    limited
                                                    purpose. This is the only religion that can triumph over
                                                    materialism
                                                    by including and anticipating the discoveries of science and
                                                    the
                                                    speculations of philosophy. It is the only religion which
                                                    impresses
                                                    on mankind the closeness of God to us and by which man can
                                                    approach
                                                    God. It is the only religion which insists every moment upon
                                                    the
                                                    fact, which all religions also acknowledge that He is in all
                                                    men and
                                                    all things and that in Him we move and have our being. It is
                                                    the
                                                    only religion which enables us not only to understand and
                                                    believe
                                                    this truth but to realize it with every part of our being.
                                                    It is the
                                                    only religion which shows the world that the world is ‘the
                                                    Leela’ of
                                                    Vasudeva. It is the only religion which shows us how we can
                                                    best
                                                    play our part in that Leela, its subtlest laws and its
                                                    noblest
                                                    rules. It is the only religion which does not separate life
                                                    in any
                                                    smallest detail from religion, which knows what immortality
                                                    is and
                                                    has completely removed from us the reality of death.

                                                    That word
                                                    is now finished. I spoke once before, when this Power was

                                                    within me, and I said then, that this movement is not a

                                                    movement and that nationalism is not politics but a
                                                    religion, a
                                                    creed, a faith. I say it again today, but I put it in

                                                    religion, a faith; I say that it is the ‘Sanatan Dharma’

                                                    was
                                                    possible for the Sanatan Dharma to perish then it would have
