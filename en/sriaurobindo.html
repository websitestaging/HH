                                                    Paul’s. Sri Aurobindo was an excellent student and won a scholarship
                                                    to read classics at King’s College Cambridge. It was at university
                                                    that the young Aurobindo became increasingly interested in the
                                                    fledgling Indian independence movement. Given a chance to enter the
                                                    civil service, Aurobindo deliberately failed as he didn’t want to
                                                    work for the British Empire.

                                                    he took up a position as a teacher. It was also on returning to
                                                    India that Aurobindo recounts his first most significant spiritual
                                                    experience. He relates on how returning to Indian soil he was
                                                    inundated with a profound peace. This experience came unsought but
                                                    at the same time, he continued to become more deeply connected with
                                                    the Indian independence movement. Aurobindo was one of the first
                                                    Indian leaders to openly call for complete Indian independence; at
                                                    the time, the Indian Congress wanted only a partial independence. In
                                                    1908 Aurobindo was implicated in the Alipore bomb plot in which two
                                                    people died. As a consequence, Aurobindo was jailed whilst awaiting
                                                    trial.

                                                    and inwardly received spiritual instruction from Swami Vivekananda
                                                    and Sri Krishna. From the depths of the British prison, Aurobindo
                                                    saw that Brahmin or God pervaded the entire world. There was nothing
                                                    that was separated from the existence of God. Even in the worst

                                                    decided to move to the French province of Pondicherry where he began

                                                some of
                                                the most detailed and comprehensive discourses on spiritual
                                                evolution. Sri Aurobindo said that his inspiration to write came
                                                from his inner pilot, from a higher source. Sri Aurobindo wrote
                                                extensively, in particular, he spent many hours patiently replying
                                                to the questions and problems of his disciples. Even on the smallest
                                                detail, Sri Aurobindo would reply with great care, attention and
                                                often good humour. It is interesting to note that Sri Aurobindo
                                                often refused to write for prestigious newspapers and journals, he
                                                frequently turned down requests to return to leadership of the
                                                Indian independence movement. Sri Aurobindo was also a Seer Poet of
                                                the highest order. His epic Savitri is a testimony to his own
                                                spiritual sadhana. For over 20 years he continually refined and
                                                amended this mantric poetic output. It became one of the most
                                                powerful testimonies of his spiritual consciousness.

                                                    only a small number of close disciples. However, he kept his written

                                    Bengal. In
                                    this speech, he shared his spiritual experiences during his stay in the
                                    jail. He
                                    gave a message on the true spirit of nationalism and also explained clearly
                                    what a
                                    true Hindu religion or ‘Sanatan Dharm’ is all about? He emphasized on why

                                                    about the subject chosen for today, the subject of the Hindu

                                                    At that time, I was not alone, one of the mightiest

                                                    seclusion to which God had sent him, so that in the silence

                                                    solitude of his cell he might hear the word that He had to
                                                    say. It
                                                    was he that you came in hundreds to welcome. Now he is far
                                                    away,
                                                    separated from us by thousands of miles. Other people, whom

                                                    the north rotting in detention. I looked around when I came
                                                    out, I
                                                    looked around for those, whom I was accustomed to look for

                                                    and inspiration. I did not find them.

                                                    country was alive with the cry of ‘Vande Mataram’, alive
                                                    with the
                                                    hope of formation of a nation. This was the hope of millions

                                                    listened for that cry, but there was instead a silence. A
                                                    hush had
                                                    fallen over the country and men seemed bewildered; for
                                                    instead of
                                                    God’s bright heaven full of vision of the future that had

                                                    before us, there seemed to be overhead, a leaden sky from
                                                    which
                                                    human thunders and lightnings rained. No man seemed to know
                                                    which
                                                    way to move, and from all sides came the question, “What
                                                    shall we do
                                                    next? What is there that we can do?” I too did not know
                                                    which way to
                                                    move, I too did not know what next to be done. But one thing
                                                    I knew,
                                                    that as it was the Almighty Power of God which had raised
                                                    that cry,
                                                    that hope, so it was the same Power which had sent down that

                                                    with a message, and it was an inspired message. I remember
                                                    the
                                                    speech he made here. It was a speech not so much political
                                                    as
                                                    religious in its bearing and intention. He spoke of his
                                                    realization
                                                    in jail, of God within us all, of the Lord within the

                                                    his subsequent speeches also he spoke of a greater than
                                                    ordinary
                                                    force in the movement and a greater than ordinary purpose
                                                    before it.
                                                    Today, I meet you again, I also have come out of jail, and

                                                    me, not at
                                                    a political meeting but at a meeting of a society for the
                                                    protection
                                                    of our religion. That message which Bipin Chandra Pal
                                                    received in
                                                    Buxar jail; God gave to me in Alipore. That knowledge, He
                                                    gave me
                                                    day after day during my twelve months of imprisonment and it
                                                    is that
                                                    which He has commanded me to speak to you now that I have

                                                    meant only for a year of seclusion and training. How could

                                                    hold me in jail longer than was necessary for God’s purpose?
                                                    He had
                                                    given me a message to speak and a work to do, and until that
                                                    message
                                                    was told, I knew that no human power could hush me, until

                                                    was done no human power could stop God’s instrument, however
                                                    weak
                                                    that instrument might be or however small. Now that I have
                                                    come out,
                                                    even in these few minutes, a word had been suggested to me
                                                    which I
                                                    had no wish to speak. The thing I had in my mind, He has
                                                    thrown them
                                                    away and what I speak is under an inspiration and

                                                    all activities, to go into seclusion and to look into

                                                    again and said, “The bonds you did not have the strength to
                                                    break, I
                                                    have broken for you, because it is not my will nor was it
                                                    ever my
                                                    intention that it should continue. I have another thing for
                                                    you to
                                                    do and it is for that, I have brought you here, to teach you
                                                    what
                                                    you could not learn for yourself and to train you for my

                                                    He placed the Gita in my hands.

                                                    but the ‘Sanatan Dharma’ is life itself; it is a thing that

                                                    often of the Hindu religion, of the ‘Sanatan Dharma’, but

                                                    really know what that religion is. Other religions are
                                                    predominantly
                                                    religions of faith and fasting, but the ‘Sanatan Dharma’ is
                                                    life
                                                    itself; it is a thing that is not so much to be believed as

                                    sentry over me. When I lay on the coarse blankets that were given to me for

                                    I felt the arms of Sri Krishna around me, the arms of my Friend and Lover.

                                                    the murderers, the swindlers, and as I looked at them, I saw

                                                    misused bodies. Amongst these thieves and dacoits there were

                                                    did not
                                                    know how to read and write, an alleged dacoit sentenced to

                                                    years’ rigorous imprisonment, one of those whom we look down

                                                    our pharisaical pride of class as ‘Chhotalok’(low class).

                                                    said to me, “when you were cast into jail, did not your

                                                    the Magistrate, look at the Prosecuting Counsel.” I looked
                                                    and it
                                                    was not the Magistrate whom I saw, it was Vasudeva, it was
                                                    Narayana
                                                    who was sitting there on the bench. I looked at the
                                                    Prosecuting
                                                    Counsel and it was not the counsel for the prosecution that
                                                    I saw;
                                                    it was Sri Krishna who sat there, it was my Lover and Friend

                                                    there and smiled. “Do you fear now?” He said, “I am in all

                                                    It is not for you. It was not for the trial that I brought

                                                    Court, I began to write instructions for my Counsel as to
                                                    what was
                                                    false in the evidence against me and on what points the

                                                    might be cross-examined. Then something happened which I had

                                                    expected. The arrangements which had been made for my

                                                    me. He
                                                    came unexpectedly-a friend of mine, but I did not know he

                                                    seclusion, I felt them utterly. I knew then that as a man, I

                                                    many of them I discovered a mighty courage, a power of

                                                    Among
                                                    them, there were one or two, who were not only like me in

                                                    and character, as there were many like that, but were also
                                                    far
                                                    superior in the promise of that intellectual ability on

                                                    prided myself. He said to me, “This is the young generation,
                                                    the new
                                                    and mighty nation that is arising at my command. They are

                                                    than yourself. What have you to fear? If you stood aside or
                                                    slept,
                                                    the work would still be done. If you were cast aside
                                                    tomorrow, here
                                                    are the young men who will take up your work and do it more
                                                    effectively than you have ever done. You have only got some
                                                    strength
                                                    from me to speak a word to this nation which will help to
                                                    raise it.”
                                                    This was the second thing that He told me.

                                                    was hurried away to the seclusion of a solitary cell. What

                                                    to me during that period I am not impelled to say, but only

                                                    inclined to believe that they were imaginations, that there

                                                    were opened to me which no material science could explain.

                                                    Him long ago in Baroda, few years before the Swadeshi began

                                                    the truth of the Vedas, the truth of the Gita, the truth of

                                                    this Yoga, a mighty truth in this religion based on the

                                                    I have shown you that I am everywhere and, in all men, and

                                                    and you do another. You aim at a result and your efforts sub

                                                    smallest detail from religion, which knows what immortality

                                                    has completely removed from us the reality of death.

                                                    speak to you today. What I intended to speak has been put

                                                    me, and beyond what is given to me I have nothing else to

                                                    That word
                                                    is now finished. I spoke once before, when this Power was
                                                    working
                                                    within me, and I said then, that this movement is not a
                                                    political
                                                    movement and that nationalism is not politics but a
                                                    religion, a
                                                    creed, a faith. I say it again today, but I put it in

                                                    religion, a faith; I say that it is the ‘Sanatan Dharma’

                                                    Dharma’, with it, it moves and with it, it prospers. When

                                                    was
                                                    possible for the Sanatan Dharma to perish then it would have

                                                    possible for this nation to perish. The Sanatan Dharma alone
                                                    is
                                                    nationalism. This is the message that I have to speak to
