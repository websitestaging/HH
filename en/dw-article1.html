                                            about a direct experience. In the absence of any result, I consider doing
                                            any work a waste. Today’s “Bahirmukhi” (outwardly focussed) spiritual
                                            practices do not result in any kind of direct realization. Relying on

                                            (religious activities) all through his life, still he doesn’t get anything.

                                            era have very cleverly made different beliefs and principles. That the

                                            and trust, the man is made to slog all his life. In this way life of
                                            countless people in this world has been made meaningless. This was the
                                            reason that slowly I became completely an atheist since it is my nature,
                                            that I say what I think and I also do what I say. People are atheist only
                                            for name sake, the atheism disappears when faced with difficulty of a small
                                            nature. Country like Russia also had re-opened the prayer places of all the
                                            religions during the World War Second.

                                            to the fear of death, happily agreed to do as told. At that time my mental

                                            other side, I was fervently praying to that unseen power to save my life. In

                                            of concentration and prayer constantly remained the same. Morning from four
                                            to seven and in the evening from seven to nine, chanting continued
                                            uninterrupted. The chanting was stopped on the very next day of the
                                            completion of one lakh twenty- five thousand chants. Out of habit I woke up
                                            at 4:00 am but since chanting wasn’t to be done, keeping my eyes closed, I
                                            kept lying on the bed.

                                            day of the ‘navratri’ that commences in winter, so it was very cold. While I
                                            was lying under the quilt with my eyes closed, I saw “A strange type of
                                            white light within me from navel till throat”. No other parts of the body
                                            like liver, spleen, heart or lungs were visible except for the light. I was
                                            surprised to see this light within me, as light is seen through the eyes.
                                            Apart from this, why wasn’t any part of the body visible in spite of the
                                            fierce white light. The moment I concentrated there, I heard humming sound
                                            of bees which was coming from the navel. I wondered how the sound of bees is
                                            coming from my stomach.

                                            position much lower than eyes and ears. The concentration broke at around
                                            five O’clock due to the sound of water dropping from the tap in the bathroom

                                            for career. Thought, may be due to following a particular routine for such a
                                            long period and having concentrated on it constantly that the thought stayed
                                            behind. But after this incident, such a transformation occurred that I
                                            became completely incapable of consuming ‘Paan’, cigarette, tea etc. The
                                            very thought of using them brought a huge state of unrest within me. This
                                            way even though desired, it became impossible to use them. Eating food with
                                            anyone or having to tell a lie in any field of life, made me feel very
                                            uncomfortable.

                                            concentrated intensely on any goal of life, the outcome was seen clearly
                                            like on a television much in advance and later the incident would happen
                                            exactly the way as it was revealed to me. This way for about an year, I
                                            received countless proofs constantly and they all happened in the physical

                                            deciding to pray to that supreme power, I started praying. Keeping a picture
                                            of Lord Shri Krishna in front just like Gayatri, I started chanting a ‘beej
                                            mantra’ of Krishna. I neither decided the total number of chants to be done
                                            nor any specific goal for this worship. Only out of curiosity to see when
                                            and what happens. The chanting continued for about two and a half to three
                                            years in the morning and evening in the same way as before.

                                            far must be more than many hundred times of Gayatri mantra still haven’t got
                                            any such realization. The moment I thought so, a strange situation
                                            developed. All the time a shadow was visible when glanced sideways. When I
                                            looked straight, nothing was seen. Thought maybe its an eye disease, went to
                                            the doctors but no such disease was found. The chanting continued as before.
                                            One day a thought occurred that I have no knowledge of this discipline, so
                                            unnecessarily shouldn’t fall into unseen problems hence stopped the chanting
                                            of the mantra but the shadow continued to be seen. I thought since it is not
                                            causing any harm so if it is still visible then let it be

                                            was sleeping in my village, around five in the morning I heard a voice which
                                            distinctly said” Beta(Son) now chant only ‘Krishna’. This voice was heard
                                            very clearly two times. Suddenly I woke up but who said it, couldn’t
                                            understand. I still didn’t chant. But since I was in the habit of chanting
                                            for years, it felt awkward without chanting.

                                            comes from the other end,” See, this is what the removal of curtain means.”
                                            I said this is a very nice thing and for this only, I have been doing all
                                            this. Then I hear the voice saying, "This is all right but then there is a
                                            word “Yogbhrast”, what is it? Do you know anything about it?" I said, during
                                            the time of spiritual practice (Aradhana), any wrong doing results in
                                            downfall of the spiritual practice. The voice from the other side said it is
                                            almost right but is not the right definition of it.

                                            positions for Worker’s Union and Rajasthan Farmer’s Union. But the way I had
                                            developed complete faith in the miracles of the spiritual world, my
                                            attention was constantly focussed there. I had almost become used to doing
                                            most of the work of physical world through the guidance of the spiritual
                                            powers. This was the reason that I was rarely unsuccessful in my work.
                                            Whatever work I undertook, I was successful in it. In 1982 I had got a clear
                                            message to separate myself from the worker’s union, but I didn’t pay much
                                            attention to it. As a result of not obeying the order, I had to face a lot
                                            of failures and disappointments in the physical world whereas earlier
                                            whatever work I undertook, I used to be successful in it.

                                            physically left the world. Met Baba Ramnathji, resident of Sujandesar, at
                                            Bikaner station, while he was on his way to Jamsar for organizing the first

                                            hearing from him, the news of Baba’s
                                            leaving the world, I was stunned (felt the ground slipping from under my
                                            feet). Baba Ramnathji requested several times to come for the ‘bhandara’ but
                                            declining his request with a heavy heart, I went to Ganagashahar. The
                                            support of my physical father was snatched from me at the tender age of
                                            three and the Spiritual father also left me in a few days, leaving me under
                                            the care of God. This way just like in my physical life, I was forced to go
                                            through immense struggle in spiritual life too.

                                            obstructed, only one path has been left open. I feel very disappointed when
                                            I see that I have been left all alone to fight with demonic tendencies of
                                            the world. But when I look back on my past, I derive some strength from the
                                            fact that despite being all alone, defeating the opposite and extremely
                                            difficult situations in my life, I have reached till here.

                                            this way by the strength of his Spiritual power, he calls that person to him
                                            and gets his surrender and at the time of surrender, based on the principles

                                            based on this experience, I set out on all fronts without bothering at all
                                            for physical comforts.

                                            assured me that no work can stop in the absence of physical amenities. When
                                            I glance at my situations from the beginning till date, I find that the
                                            power that is being exhibited through me by the supreme force does not have
                                            even a fraction of contribution from my intellect or any of the powers
                                            within me. Despit my not being interested in it, that power is making me
                                            dance to its tune. That is why whatever is getting done through me, I do not
                                            have any sense of doer ship for that. I am completely assured in relation to
                                            this. I am not in any kind of doubt.
