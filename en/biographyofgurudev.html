                                    for Worker’s Union and Rajasthan Farmer’s Union. Since he had developed complete
                                    faith in the miracles of the spiritual world, his attention was constantly focussed
                                    there. He had almost become used to doing most of the work of physical world through
                                    the guidance of the spiritual powers. This was the reason that he was rarely
                                    unsuccessful in his work. Whatever work he undertook; he was successful in it.

                                    experiencing a
                                    new calm. He returned to Bikaner from Palana, where he had taken a refuge following
                                    his
                                    turmoil-ridden phase, reported back to work and resumed normal duties in the office.
                                    Strangely, no one took any serious objection to his long unofficial absence from
                                    work, which
                                    would have normally led to his being fired from the job. It was as if he had never
                                    deserted
                                    his job at all. This was two years after he had first prayed at the Samadhi of his
                                    Guru Baba
                                    Gangainathji.
